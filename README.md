# Nextcloud-High-availability
CloudFormation template for deploying a highly available Nextcloud instance
I've created a comprehensive CloudFormation template for deploying a highly available Nextcloud instance. Here's what this template includes:
Key Features:

High Availability & Auto Scaling:

    Auto Scaling Group with 2-6 instances across multiple AZ's
    Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
    CloudWatch-based scaling policies (CPU-driven)

Infrastructure Components:

    VPC: Custom VPC with public/private subnets across 2 AZs
    Aurora: MySQL-compatible Aurora cluster with 2 instances for HA
    EFS: Shared storage for Nextcloud data persistence
    Route53: DNS record pointing to the load balancer
    CloudWatch: Monitoring dashboard and alarms

Security:

    Security groups with least-privilege access
    Database in private subnets
    NAT Gateways for private subnet internet access
    Encrypted EFS and Aurora storage

Nextcloud Deployment:

    Containerized Nextcloud using Docker Compose
    Shared storage via EFS for multi-instance compatibility
    CloudWatch agent for application monitoring

Deployment Steps:

    Prerequisites:
        Create an EC2 Key Pair
        Have a Route53 hosted zone ready
        Update the AMI ID for your region (currently set for us-east-1)
    Deploy the stack:

    bash

    aws cloudformation create-stack \
      --stack-name nextcloud-ha \
      --template-body file://nextcloud-template.yaml \
      --parameters ParameterKey=KeyPairName,ParameterValue=your-key-pair \
                   ParameterKey=DomainName,ParameterValue=nextcloud.yourdomain.com \
                   ParameterKey=HostedZoneId,ParameterValue=your-zone-id \
                   ParameterKey=DBMasterPassword,ParameterValue=your-db-password \
                   ParameterKey=NextcloudAdminPassword,ParameterValue=your-admin-password \
      --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

Post-Deployment Considerations:

    SSL/TLS: Add an SSL certificate to the ALB listener for HTTPS
    Backup Strategy: Configure Aurora automated backups and EFS backup
    Monitoring: Review the CloudWatch dashboard and set up additional alerts
    Performance: Adjust EFS throughput and Aurora instance sizes based on usage

The template creates a production-ready Nextcloud deployment that can handle failures and automatically scale based on demand. All data is persisted and shared across instances using EFS, ensuring consistency in a multi-instance setup.
